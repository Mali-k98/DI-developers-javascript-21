            <p>The potato has been an essential part of the world's diet for centuries. Originally cultivated in South America's Andean Mountains, potatoes found their way to Europe during the 16th century. By the end of 17th century the potato had become an important crop in Ireland. Today potatoes are grown in over 100 countries and in all 50 of the United States. According to the USDA, the average American eats 140 pounds of potatoes each year, including over 50 pounds of French fries!</p>

            <h1>Really imformative info</h1>
            <p>Originally cultivated by the Aztecs and Incas as early as 700 A.D., the tomato is native to the Americas. Europeans were first made aware of the tomato when explorers brought back seed from Mexico and Central America in the 16th century. Tomatoes quickly became popular in the Mediterranean countries but received resistance as they spread north. The British in particular considered the fruit to be beautiful but poisonous. This fear was shared in the American colonies and it was years before the tomato gained widespread acceptance. By the middle of the 19th century, tomatoes were in use across America. Today the tomato is generally considered to be the favorite vegetable of the American public.</p>
