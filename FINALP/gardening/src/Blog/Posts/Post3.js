            <h1>Lets talk soil</h1>
            <p>Plants have different needs, just like us. It’s important to know what those needs are, such as the different desired amounts of water, light, and temperature each plant prefers. Another key factor in your plant’s health is knowing how to choose the best soil for your houseplant. But how can you choose when the garden center is full of so many potting soil options?</p>

            <p>Cactus and Succulent Mix often starts with the main ingredient of peat moss (an organic matter found in many soil blends known for its absorbency and ability to release moisture as needed). Peat moss is hard to saturate and dries out quickly, preventing your succulents and cacti from being overwatered. This mix should also include a well draining rocky substance, such as perlite or pumice. Sand is also a key ingredient within this mix. Sand, like perlite, promotes the soil from compacting and keeps the soil aerated. </p>
            <p>Potting soil refers to blends that include actual dirt and are much denser than a potting mix. Potting soil is typically used for garden or planting beds. Regular potting soil may also include other soil-less ingredients such as perlite, vermiculite, or sphagnum (peat) moss. While some potting soil mixes include these good indoor potting mediums, potting soil is much more likely to hold moisture, compact the root system, become waterlogged, and prevent proper aeration that many houseplants need.</p>
            <p>Potting mix is designed for plants that live in containers or pots. With its fluffy and light texture, it maximizes aeration and drainage ability, and it keeps the “soil” from becoming too dense. Potting mix includes a variety of soil-less potting mediums such as perlite, vermiculite, peat moss, sand, wood fiber, and coconut fiber. If you’re feeling adventurous, try creating your own blend! We recommend using a mix of peat moss and coconut fiber. If you are potting a succulent or cactus, try adding sand or pumice to allow for appropriate drainage. </p>

            <p>Most houseplants thrive in the slightly acidic to neutral range (6.0 to 7.0). If you would like to check your soil pH, try using a soil test kit or soil pH meter. Regulating soil pH can be as simple as adding sulfur to the soil to lower pH or adding powdered limestone to increase pH.A good indoor potting mix should be made up of peat moss and other soilless mediums (coconut/wood fiber, vermiculite, perlite, etc.). While these are vital to your plants’ health, it is important to give your plants nutrients, too. Just like us, plants need to eat! This can be done by fertilizing. </p>
            
            <p>Houseplants need to have room in their soil for root growth, aeration, and proper drainage. If a soil mix contains actual dirt from outside, there is a great chance that your indoor plant won’t respond well to it. Plants also need a balanced pH and regular nutrients to keep them growing and thriving. With all of the combined measures, your plants will thank you for keeping their home healthy.</p>
