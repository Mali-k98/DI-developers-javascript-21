// Hint: To do this daily challenge, take a look at today’s lesson Pass By Value & Pass By Reference

// Copy this object using the method that was taught in today’s lesson.
// Change the value of totalPrice to 35$. Will we also see this modification in the copied objects ?
// Change the value of payed to false. Will we also see this modification in the copied objects ? Why ?

// let groceries = {
//     fruits : ["pear", "apple", "banana"],
//     vegetables: ["tomatoes", "cucumber", "salad"],
//     totalPrice : "20$",
//     other : {
//         payed : true,
//         meansOfPayment : ["cash", "creditCard"]
//     }
// }

// console.log(groceries);
